# LED-Hat
A mortarboard hat

Using Arduino Mega and a 32x32 LED array.  This will attached to my mortar board when I graduate in Spring 2018.
There is a Processing script included which will read in a 32x32 color bitmap, spilt each pixel into it's color components
and write those to a header file.

Possible future updates:
Add in SD features - Have the RGB arrays for images stored in various text files on the SD card.
Read in the arrays from the SD card, use them, then delete the arrays.  This will help with memory issues.
